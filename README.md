# User-interest-detection-in-social-media

Abstract:

Social media provides a platform for users to interact freely and share their opinions and ideas. Several researches have been conducted to predict user interests in social media. Because of the dynamic nature of social media, user interests change over time. In this paper, given a set of emerging topics and user’s interest profile over these emerging topics we are interested to predict the user interest profile for the future. We conducted this experiment on twitter data captured for 2 months from 1 November 2011 to 1 January 2012. We will be using temporal latent space to infer characteristics of users and then predict user’s future interests over these given topics. We will evaluate the results with different ranking metrics like MAP and nDCG. We will also compare our results with the results of Zhu et al. [4] temporal latent space which uses the same methodology but on a different dataset.
